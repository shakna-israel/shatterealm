If it does, then you're hitting one of my pet peeves with Python's DB API.

In these sorts of cases you're basically duplicating your own efforts, and it isn't actually necessary at all. In point of fact, Python supports installing something called a _row factory_ against the DB to change the way you access data. This example comes from the [Python documentation for sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#accessing-columns-by-name-instead-of-by-index):

	import sqlite3

	con = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
	con.row_factory = sqlite3.Row

	cur = con.cursor()
	cur.execute("select 'John' as name, 42 as age")
	for row in cur:
	    assert row[0] == row["name"]
	    assert row["name"] == row["nAmE"]
	    assert row[1] == row["age"]
	    assert row[1] == row["AgE"]

	con.close()

Here, Python even supplies their own row factory, so that you can access by both index, and case-insensitive strings. If it weren't for the case-insensitivity, I would argue that this should be a default, rather than something the programmer should be responsible for adding.

Unfortunately, I do sort of find that case-insensitivity untenable for a _generic_ database connection. If we're talking about the DB API, it shouldn't make that sort of assumption.

## Row Factory

Thus, I wrote my own factory, and a class wrapper, to get around some of these warts whilst _attempting_ to remain as unopinionated as is possible.

To start off with, we need to know what goes into making a factory, but thankfully the documentation makes that abundantly clear:

	import sqlite3

	def dict_factory(cursor, row):
	    d = {}
	    for idx, col in enumerate(cursor.description):
	        d[col[0]] = row[idx]
	    return d

	con = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
	con.row_factory = dict_factory
	cur = con.cursor()
	cur.execute("select 1 as a")
	print(cur.fetchone()["a"])

	con.close()

It turns out that Python guarantees that `cursor.description` holds everything that the programmer usually wants to know, it just doesn't normally expose it:

> This read-only attribute provides the column names of the last query.

You could just be satisfied by returning a dictionary instead, but that _will_ break any code that relies on indexing. The simplest way around that, is instead of using a dictionary, you could use a named-tuple. This would instead let us access keys in two ways, by index or `attribute`.

However, accessing by attribute (e.g. `row[0] == row.name`) isn't always desirable. We want to be unopinionated and that means letting whitespace into our column names. (e.g. `row[0] == getattr(row, "Class Name")`). Which isn't as nice.

Thankfully, overriding Python default behaviour is trivial, and we can make it so that we can access by index, attribute, _and_ by string, rather easily.

	import collections

	def dict_factory(cursor, row):
		"""This factory lets us access by index, string, or attribute.
		e.g. row[0] == row['item'] == row.item
		"""

		keys = []

		d = {}
		for idx, col in enumerate(cursor.description):
			keys.append(col[0])
			d[col[0]] = row[idx]

		def row_getitem(self, index):
			try:
				# Try numbered index first...
				return self.oldgetitem(index)
			except TypeError:
				try:
					# Probably a string key, try and get it...
					return getattr(self, index)
				except AttributeError:
					# Raise a KeyError, which feels Pythonic dict-like and intuitive
					raise KeyError
				except TypeError:
					# Raise a KeyError, which feels Pythonic dict-like and intuitive
					raise KeyError
			except IndexError:
				# Raise a KeyError for consistency.
				raise KeyError

		R = collections.namedtuple('Row', keys)
		R.oldgetitem = R.__getitem__
		R.__getitem__ = row_getitem

		ret = R(**d)

		return ret

This little row factory lets us access by all three methods, and when you access something that doesn't exist, you'll be hit by a `KeyError`, which though opinionated, feels rather Pythonic.

And now we can do:

	for row in c.execute("SELECT name, class, age FROM students WHERE class > ?", (3,)):
		students.append(row)

Or even:

	for row in c.execute("SELECT * FROM students WHERE class > ?", (3,)):
		students.append(row)

And we'll get a key-able value out of it.

However, if we're already changing the way rows behave to feel more modern and simpler, maybe we should look at the database object itself, as well.

---

## Database

There are three things I would generally want my database object to do:

1. Use our row factory. Unless I want to use another row factory.

2. Automatically commit and close the connection when it gets deleted, so I don't need to mess around with context managers. I have a garbage collector - why not use it? (This one is fairly opinionated - some people won't want the commit aspect).

3. If I try and access the database object and discover the attribute is only cursor-accessible, I want it to use the underlying cursor! I don't want to have to manage the cursors myself. (This one is very opinionated. The `sqlite3` library already does this to some extent, but it isn't required by the DB API).

Thus, we end up with a class that takes the library that matches the DB API and returns us an object that does all of that incredibly simply.

First up - let the GC handle commit and close for us. That's easy enough, Python lets us do non-deterministic things in the destructor (including raising exceptions):

	def __del__(self):
		# Auto-commit DB in closing...
		self.db.commit()
		self.db.close()

We'll also need to override the way our class gets attributes, to look first at itself (for any methods we define/override), then to the DB object, and then to a cursor object:

	def __getattr__(self, *args, **kwargs):
		"""Defers to underlying DB object, and then to cursor, if the method doesn't exist."""
		try:
			return self.__getattribute__(*args, **kwargs)
		except AttributeError:
			try:
				return getattr(self.db, *args, **kwargs)
			except AttributeError:
				c = self.db.cursor()
				return getattr(c, *args, **kwargs)

Python having both `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` becomes a saving grace for us here, simplifying our code at the expense of becoming non-intuitive for anyone trying to piece together how it works. Basically, `getattr`, the attribute accessor, will check the short name first, and if it isn't defined, check the long name, but both are defined when you inherit from `object`. Thus, we don't need to copy the default behaviour anywhere before we create our override.

Altogether, our very simple class looks like:

	class Database(object):
		def __init__(self, sql_engine, path, row_factory=None, *args, **kwargs):
			self.db = sql_engine.connect(path, *args, **kwargs)
			if row_factory == None:
				self.db.row_factory = dict_factory

		def execute(self, *args, **kwargs):
			"""Opens a new cursor and runs an execute"""
			c = self.db.cursor()
			return c.execute(*args, **kwargs)

		def executemany(self, *args, **kwargs):
			"""Opens a new cursor and runs an executemany"""
			c = self.db.cursor()
			return c.executemany(*args, **kwargs)

		def __getattr__(self, *args, **kwargs):
			"""Defers to underlying DB object, and then to cursor, if the method doesn't exist."""
			try:
				return self.__getattribute__(*args, **kwargs)
			except AttributeError:
				try:
					return getattr(self.db, *args, **kwargs)
				except AttributeError:
					c = self.db.cursor()
					return getattr(c, *args, **kwargs)

		def __del__(self):
			# Auto-commit DB in closing...
			self.db.commit()
			self.db.close()

## Summing Up

Taken together, the `class` and the `dict_factory` we made earlier are a mostly backwards-compatible interface to the DB API, but now we don't have to repeat ourselves when moving between SQL and Python.

So simple in fact, that the [single-file library](https://git.sr.ht/~shakna/shaknas_database_py) is less than 80 LOC.

But will let us do things like:

	import sqlite3
	import database

	# Pass the underlying driver to the initialiser...
	db = database.Database(sqlite3, "data.db")

	db.execute("""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "comments" (
		"thread"	BLOB NOT NULL,
		"content"	BLOB NOT NULL,
		"username"	BLOB NOT NULL,
		"time"	REAL NOT NULL
	);""")

	for row in db.execute("SELECT * from comments"):
		print(row)

		# Access by index
		print(row[1])

		# Access by attribute
		print(row.content)

		# Access by string
		print(row['content'])

		# Access non-existent values
		try:
			row['nope!']
		except KeyError:
			pass

	# Transparently access cursor attributes
	print(db.connection)

	# No explicit close/commit. Let the GC handle things!
