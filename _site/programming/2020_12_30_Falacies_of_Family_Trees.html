Recently, I attempt to create a family tree for a mythological family. I did expect to hit some problems, because some parts of the family tree aren't possible in the real world.

To demonstrate it trivially, this is the basic tree I wanted to render:

* Dawn gave birth to Dawn

* Dawn gave birth to Dyeus

* Dawn & Dyeus gave birth to Mres

* Dyeus & Dionne gave birth to Alcides

* Dawn & Alcides have three sons

* Alcides' second son and Mres gave birth to Artimus

* Dyeus & Artimus gave birth to Aides

First up: Dawn's birth is recursive. It's impossible so expecting to model that was out.

However, I soon discovered that the industry is worse than not being able to model the impossible, and can't even model the _historical_.

Almost all genealogy software uses a standard called [GEDCOM](https://www.gedcom.org/).

For inexplicable reasons, GEDCOM cannot model these things that were (unfortunately, in the first couple cases) common in human history:

* You cannot be both a _spouse_ and a _child_ of the same person.

* You cannot be both a _spouse_ and an _ancestor_ of the same person.

* You _must_ have a family name or surname. (Oh look, you must be a Klingon, Son of None).

* You cannot have a gender other than _male_ or _female_.

* You're not a husband or wife? But you are a spouse? Tough luck. There's no term for that. Good luck modelling polygamy.

Beyond that, the GEDCOM format is so damn ugly and badly thought out that extending it to cover the real world isn't really possible.

Just take a look at modelling a same-sex spousal relationship (header data excluded):

	0 @I1@ INDI
	1 NAME John /Smith/
	2 SURN Smith
	2 GIVN John
	1 SEX M
	1 BIRT
	2 DATE 1 Sep 1991
	2 PLAC Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America
	1 FAMS @F1@
	0 @I2@ INDI
	1 NAME Steven /Stevens/
	2 SURN Stevens
	2 GIVN Steven
	1 SEX M
	1 BIRT
	2 DATE 8 Aug 1988
	2 PLAC Seattle, King, Washington, United States of America
	1 FAMS @F1@
	0 @F1@ FAM
	1 HUSB @I1@
	1 WIFE @I2@
	1 MARR
	2 DATE 26 Jun 2015
	2 PLAC Portland, Mutnomah, Oregon, United States of America
	0 TRLR

Firstly: This format looks awful. It isn't easy for a human to parse, and it isn't actually that great for a machine to parse, either.

Secondly: It's a same sex relationship, but you must arbitrarily make one of them have a title of "husband", and the other "wife". Two husbands? Nah, that's ridiculous. What about other historical titles? Like "mistress"? Sorry, Madame de Pompadour your official relationship isn't allowed.

So, let's completely give up on an industry that has somehow decided that GEDCOM is the best you can do, and create our own format, and renderer to go with it.

The code I'll be exploring I put together as a new project called [shakna/genes](https://git.sr.ht/~shakna/genes), and have released under a CC0 license, because the industry really should do better than it currently is.

Python has a pretty good interface into [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/), in the `graphviz` package. This means that rendering trees _should_ be pretty easy, so long as we make it so we have all the data we need in a single pass. If we need to go beyond that, things will get extremely hectic, extremely quickly.

Sidenote: The [DOT](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) language that graphviz uses under the covers is an example of a decent standard for operating on tree data. It's way more than we need for this project, but GEDCOM could learn a few things about modelling relationships from them.

For the most part, to model our data, we need a series of statements from the user of either of these forms:

	{"Name A": "Dyeus", "Metadata": {"Gender": "Male"}}
	{"Name A": "Dawn", "Name B": "Dyeus", "Relation": "Spouse"}

That way we can:

* Add arbitrary metadata

* Add arbitrary relationships.

You do face the problem of people with the same names, but I hacked around that by letting you add a colon and arbtirary text as a specific identifier:

	{"Name A": "Dawn:10", "Name B": "Dyeus", "Relation": "Spouse"}

However, this kind of JSON-ish data isn't fun to work with, and isn't that well suited to tabular data like CSV or anything like that. But the relational tree I built with it did look a lot like the kinds of trees I was used to getting when dumping with Datalog, so I used Prolog as an inspiration, and came up with this format:

	# This is a comment!
	"Dawn" is the Spouse of "Dyeus"
	"Dawn" is the Parent of "Dawn"
	"Dawn" is the Parent of "Dyeus"
	"Dawn" is the Parent of "Mres"
	"Dawn" has a Gender of "Female"

	"Dyeus" is the Parent of "Mres"
	"Dyeus" is the Parent of "Alcides"
	"Dyeus" has a Gender of "Male"

	"Mres" has a Gender of "Male"

	"Dionne" is the Parent of "Alcides"
	"Dionne" has a Gender of "Female"
	"Alcides" has a Gender of "Male"

	"Unknown:1" is the Child of "Dawn"
	"Unknown:1" is the Child of "Alcides"
	"Unknown:1" is the Spouse of "Mres"
	"Unknown:1" has a Gender of "Male"

	"Artimus" is the Child of "Unknown:1"
	"Artimus" is the Child of "Mres"
	"Artimus" has a Gender of "Female"

	"Artimus" is the Parent of "Aides"
	"Aides" has a Gender of "Male"

This has the benefit of modelling _everything_ that was in our original tree, whilst remaining entirely flexible. It's easy to read, meaning it is also easy to edit.

Basically lines beginning with `#` are comments, so easy to ignore.

Then the line is of either of these forms:

* `<name> is the <relationship> of <name>`

* `<name> has a <attribute> of <value>`

* The line is tokenised using POSIX shell rules, so I can use Python's inbuilt `shlex` module and not have to try and parse quotes.

This is extensible, human-readable, and flexible. You're not rail-roaded into any preconceived notion by the format. The renderer might end up with certain assumptions, but it easier to extend a renderer, than it is to extend a format.

In our case, the render looks like:

![Mythological Tree](/images/falacies.png)

The entire thing, including the parser (and error checking) for the format, and the data munger to put everything into a single-pass structure so we can render easily with `graphviz`, is a piddling 262 lines of code.

It isn't the prettiest code in the world, but it should be easy to extend as I discover more assumptions that would be plain impossible to model in GEDCOM.

Whilst I haven't built a GUI for this, looking at a GUI, versus the simple statements in our format, it is clear to me which I would rather use when spelling out the massive number of complicated relationships that can arise in a genealogy.
