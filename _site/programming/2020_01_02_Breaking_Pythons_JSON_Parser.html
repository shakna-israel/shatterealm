Python's JSON Parser isn't particularly robust. This is well known, and what this post explores isn't going to come as news to a lot of Python programmers. It may be to some, but that's not the point.

The point is that it is _embarassingly_ bad.

If you go to the [documentation page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), and search for "RecursionError", and you will find 0 references.

If you go to [`json.loads`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads), in particular, you'll find the text:

> Deserialize s (a str, bytes or bytearray instance containing a JSON document) to a Python object using this conversion table.

> The other arguments have the same meaning as in load().

> If the data being deserialized is not a valid JSON document, a JSONDecodeError will be raised.

> Changed in version 3.6: s can now be of type bytes or bytearray. The input encoding should be UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32.

> Changed in version 3.9: The keyword argument encoding has been removed.

Notably, the only error mentioned, is `JSONDecodeError`.

So, you might reasonably expect that this function can only raise this error, or catostrophic errors like `MemoryError`.

You would be dead wrong.

Here's a very small bit of text:

Depending on your system, if you try and toss that at Python, and load it as JSON, you _will_ hit `RecursionError`. Unexpectedly. Especially as there is no reason at all to believe that the above code is valid JSON. You would expect it to hand you a `JSONDecodeError`. You want it to. But it won't.

In point of fact, it turns out to be ridiculously easy to create a script to create a minimal payload that will break Python's JSON loader:

	#!/bin/sh

	# Python will hit it's recursion limit
	# If you supply just 4 less than the recursion limit
	# I assume this means there's a few objects on the call stack first
	# Probably: __main__, print, json.loads, and input.

	n="$(python3 -c 'import math; import sys; sys.stdout.write(str(math.floor(sys.getrecursionlimit() - 4)))')"

	echo "N: $n"

	# Obviously invalid, but unparseable without matching pair
	# JSON's grammar is... Not good at being partially parsed.
	left="$(yes [ | head -n "$n" | tr -d '\n')"

	# Rather than exploding with the expected decodeError
	# This will explode with a RecursionError
	echo "$left" | python3 -c 'import json; print(json.loads(input()))'

On my particular platform, the reported `N` value to break Python's JSON is `996`. In the presence of a real program, with values already on the stack, that `N` will _decrease_.

Python is regularly used on the server, and on the web, where this will show up, sooner or later.

For example, if you look at [`requests`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/master/requests/models.py#L876), it just passes the exception on to the user from `request.json()`, where the user might reasonably be expected to catch a decoding error. But again, there's no mention that you can even hit a `RecursionError`.

It seems that expecting Python to raise a `JSONDecodeError` for invalid JSON data is... Folly. Python cannot verify that the data actually matches the JSON specification at all.
