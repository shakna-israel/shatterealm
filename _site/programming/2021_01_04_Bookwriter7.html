	value = [[For some time now, I've been using a series of hacky layers around the standard [TeXInfo](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) pipeline to generate my book files for me.

I like TeXInfo. It gives me just another formatting tools whilst generally staying out of my way, and makes doing tasks that sound simple, actually simple, unlike in LaTeX.

However, my tool was... Well. Here's [bookwriter6](https://git.sr.ht/~shakna/bookwriter6).

It has two other scripts as hidden payloads inside itself. One which is an INI parser in shell, (which I maintain [here](https://git.sr.ht/~shakna/minini/)), and the other converts straight double-quotes into the appropriate curled quote based as a Python script.

This is obviously not ideal, especially for maintainence.

Unfortunately, I wanted backwards compatibility. I have a number of books I've already written using the tool, like [XavLab](https://git.sr.ht/~shakna/XavLabTex), and there is no way in hell I'm rewriting anything in those to fit a new tool. A number of the books also include their own macros and so on.

Thus, bookwriter languished for a while with bugs and undesirable behaviour like only being able to fetch the reading time if you do a new render.

No more!

The [new release](https://git.sr.ht/~shakna/bookwriter) is 100% backwards compatible, and written in Python. It should be more maintainable, though I'll admit writing TeX inside Python's template strings is an infuriating experience.

As well as being backwards compatible, however, it is now also sports a few extensions, and the ability to be used as a library for more complicated build pipelines.

I was able to drop-in replace the old version, including not breaking any of the hack-y wrapper scripts in some of the older versions of the books, whilst knowing that future versions aren't going to be held back by that behaviour anymore.

There are differences - like a _much_ nicer default CSS, but I've never really made any guarantees about styling information and you can supply your own scripts to override that anyway.

I also went out of my way to make use of `pathlib`, so it _might_ just be possible for someone to port bookwriter to Windows, which was practically an impossibility earlier.
