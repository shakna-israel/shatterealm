This is something I've intended to write about for a very long time, but finding the right approach has eluded me. Partially because it is so personal a thing, a deeply intimate thing, and regardless of my approach it will have detractors.

There will be people offended by my own perspective, and there will be people who are offensive to my own perspective.

The largest difficulty I have when considering how to explain a life with pain is simply that I no longer recall a life without it. I am in pain every moment I am awake. I am in pain every moment that I am dreaming. The only thing that changes is where the pain is, and to what scale it is presenting.

There will already be some readers feeling the need to reach out, to try and offer suggestions for how to treat my pain.

Don't.

This is lesson one for living with pain: Nobody else thinks it's about you.

### The Sympathies of the Crowd

The reasons that people immediately reach out with advice when they hear you're suffering are numerous, but understandable. They mostly come down to a handful of small things:

* They think they're helping you. They do truly believe that by extolling the virtues of some treatment or another, they are offering you an avenue to a world with less pain.

* They don't really know how they're supposed to react to the concept that the person near to them is suffering. The instinct is to try and find a way to reduce that suffering, and the fallacy that they believe in is that they can in fact reduce that suffering if they speak up.

These two ideas aren't confined just to chronic pain sufferers, but any chronic illness. Ranging from depression to cancer, if you mention your illness, even in passing, expect that the people around you will react not with sympathy or empathy, but with the intent to _fix_ you.

Most of the time, they're coming from the right place - they just haven't learned that this isn't a helpful behaviour, but an incredibly harmful one.

In the course of my own personal journey I have seen more than a dozen specialists, and I actively see three who have specialised training in just my particular illness. I have been suffering with this illness for more than half my life.

At this point, it is not possible for you to raise a coping method, or a treatment option, that neither I nor my specialist team have not heard about, and considered.

The _only_ thing you will do by raising the topic with me is remind me that this is as good as it gets. You are reminding me of a life I cannot have.

To put it another way... A veteran mentions that they are in a wheelchair because they lost their leg because of an IED. The entire group then immediately asks them if they've considered methods that might one day lead to them regrowing their leg. Have you heard about leg transplants? Isn't cloning exciting?

Sure. One day.

Right now, they don't have a leg. Thank you for reminding them you do, and they don't, and that you have a complete lack of understanding of their situation.

In your instinct to do good, you've done harm.

Unless someone is actively asking for advice, don't offer it. If someone does ask for advice, but sets certain parameters, don't stray outside them. You might think that they're being overly contrained, and want to offer something they haven't considered - but you are _not_ the one who should be judging that.

You may seek to be helpful, but in your sympathy you have done nothing but be selfish.

If you want do to do good, follow those two rules. Treat them as law.

Which, of course, begs the question of what you are _supposed_ to do when faced with the terrifying prospect of talking to someone that you _can't_ help?

The answer, surprisingly, is that you _can_ help. You sympathise. In all likelihood, you cannot empathise. Most people with my particular condition are aware that they cannot empathise with each other. There's a dizzying array of symptoms, and everyone copes with it in different ways. None of us live exactly the same lives as another, and so we can't empathise. But we can sympathise.

Sympathy takes on many shapes and sizes.

It may be the friend who can stand in silence, but express consideration. It might be the friend who wonders if they can assist with housework. It might be the friend who plays a game with you. It might just be the one who lets you rant about your day without judgement, and without offering to fix things. A listener.

It's a lot harder than offering unwanted advice, but most things are.

### Scales of Pain

One of my greatest frustrations is the frequency with which I encounter people who think that their pain qualifies them to speak to my own experience. I'm not going to try and speak to yours, but they probably aren't comparable, so don't try because otherwise you are demonstrating that we have nothing to speak about.

The pain someone feels every moment of their life is different than the one they feel in a singular moment.

A stubbed toe is quite painful and can break through the monotony of other pain and get attention, depending on what the sufferers background pain is like. That doesn't mean the stubbed toe makes them suffer worse, or less, or anything at all. It could cause flare ups, or be ignored, or get a normal reaction.

Like I said - most pain isn't comparable.

However, as unfortunate as it is, scales of pain is one tool that can be useful to help people understand at least a small part of what I suffer. I'm not going to point to a place on a 1-10 scale. That information is practically useless in my day-to-day. What I suffer at 5:38PM may be radically different than 5:40PM.

Yet, I will point out a few comparisons that might help.

For a lot of people, a bad headache is less than a migraine, but still incredibly painful. A migraine kicks it up a notch, and a long-lived migraine produces sympathy in almost everyone around you.

I suffer from something truly wonderful called a bilateral [cluster headache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache), a.k.a. "the suicide headache". Sufferers are known to beat their skull against something solid so that they can pass out to be free from it. These headaches make migraines seem like a mosquito bite, a quiet irritation.

That's not to speak against migraine sufferers - as I've tried to say, pain is a deeply personal thing. If you are currently suffering from the worst pain you have ever known, _you are suffering from the worst pain you have ever known_. Pain scales to our experience, and should be treated that way by both ourselves and the people around us. I have friends with those conditions, and have listened to them rant away with a sympathetic ear on a regular basis for years, and I feel no less for them now, as when they got their first migraine.

My cluster headaches last anywhere from a week to six months. There are gaps between the worst periods - that's where the "cluster" comes from, but they tend to measure in minutes. The entire time I have one, it feels like it builds in intensity (for the days or months), and I find myself despising the people around me. I warn them of my condition, and for about a day they step lightly, and then return to old habits.

Things as simple as turning up the TV because there is background noise isn't just offensive to me, but like punching me in the face repeatedly.

If I draw the curtains because I can't stand the light, and then someone comes along behind me and throws them open thinking that it might be nice to have some more light in the room. This one is so often followed by someone smiling at me and asking me if I'm grateful. No. No, I am fucking not. I hate you.

If you make a clever knock on a door, I want to throttle you. It isn't amusing. It's painful. Every knock is painful. It feels exactly like a physical assault. I'd rather be punched in the face than endure it. Which, in fact, is not hyperbole. Being punched in the face during a cluster _is_, in my experience, less painful than the cluster headache is.

The intensity of emotion that comes with this kind of intense pain is also something people are surprised by. Is it truly surprising that a condition that interferes with your brain's ability to process information gives you less space to be patient or kind? Less space to process any emotion means your brain can only treat the big ones. Anger and happiness are simple, so you can feel them even when other parts of your brain are being put on standby.

Add the drain of spending more than three months in a pain that no one around you can remotely comprehend, and the fuse isn't lit. It's expired.

You don't feel irritated. You feel hatred.

You don't feel sad. You feel anhedonic.

You don't feel tired. You feel exhausted.

If there were a dial controlling your emotions, someone turned it up and broke the knob off.

Conversely, when I am finally free of that scale of pain, for the first few days I am acutely aware of it. I can finally think easily. I can be happy. Whatever you do to irritate me, I'll probably laugh about rather than feel the slightest impatience. Because quite frankly, I no longer give a shit. I am elated and on Cloud 9. I'm above it all.

When it comes to scales of pain, I measure my experience by cluster headaches. I, personally, know nothing more painful. If you ask me for a number, it'll be in regards to that unbearable peak. So I might say that I'm having a bad day, because it's worse than normal, but still only measure it a piddling five or six on the scale. Simply because the peak of my scale involves something that regularly causes people to kill themselves to avoid.

Understanding someone else's scale of pain requires you know what the peak pain of their experience is. They'll see it through that lens. The time they fell off their bike and down a mountain path. The time they got hit by a car. The time they experienced a migraine.

If you want to understand where someone is at with their pain today, you will need to know their history of pain first.

### Fatigue

One of the worst things of all things chronic, is the fatigue. This may or may not refer to chronic fatigue. In my case it does, but all chronic sufferers suffer from fatigue in some way, and though it is easy to explain why... It is not easy for the people around them to comprehend it at a level that is necessary to not incidentally cause frustration.

If you suffer chronically, then the amount of energy you have is reduced, and the amount of energy you need to expend to do anything is increased.

Most people are fine with the concept. They understand that things like work are harder, and that you can't do as much. They tend to be okay that you can't do the same recreational activities to the same degree. There are, as always, exception to the rule, but most people do comprehend this.

However, the depth to which this fatigue penetrates your life isn't understood. I'm not even sure if it's possible to understand it in full because it involves an understanding of everything that you do without thinking about it.

It wouldn't surprise most people to learn that changing the sheets on my bed is a _hard thing_. It's fairly physical, my ailment is fairly physical. They can be surprised by the scale - I approach it in three parts over the course of an entire day, so I can recover in-between. But, again, it isn't a total surprise.

However, it is the non-crippling tasks which are also scaled up that just doesn't seem to penetrate.

Everything is harder means that _everything_ is harder.

* It takes more effort to brush your teeth.

* It takes more effort to pick up a fork.

* It takes more effort to use a keyboard.

* Chewing takes more effort.

* Breathing takes more effort.

* Looking at a screen, listening to someone speak, etc.

All things taking more effort means quite literally _all things take more effort_. There are no exceptions. And whilst it is something you adapt to, that adaptation does not mean that suddenly you are on par with everyone else. Everything still takes more effort.

If things take more effort, then you have less energy than everyone else around you, even if you're being careful to do things in a way that suits you. You've been given a handicap at the game of life, albeit one that doesn't have to be obvious to them, or even to yourself.

Unfortunately, the cruel trick of fatigue is not just to make sure you're burning through your energy at a faster rate than the people around you. Not only are you on a last-gen battery for consumption purposes, capacity is also effected. The total amount of things you can do until you're too exhausted to go on is much less. The further you push against this natural limitation, the more your body will laydown the smackdown.

You can't fight fatigue. She will always get her own back.

All of that is just general fatigue, which results in exhaustion, loss of concentration, anxiety, and an inability to think straight.

If the fatigue you experience is also chronic fatigue... Chronic fatigue doesn't deal in exhaustion. It really should have a different name so people don't associate it with fatigue. When chronic fatigue decides that you have _done enough_, then there is no fighting it. There may not even be any warning that it is coming.

It's difficult to explain it, despite living with it for so long. Almost like running into a brick wall. A shock to the system and everything just shuts down. Thoughts evaporate being the completion of a sentence. Even knowing that you can't work any more, that realisation, is difficult to have. People have found me staring in a daze and asked me if I think I should head home, and the obvious answer is 'yes'. But my brain can't process anything to actually get to that answer. It's thrown a cog.

I feel for people with fatigue. I cringe when people say they have chronic fatigue, and wish them all the sympathy in the world.

Pain will always bring fatigue along for the ride, draining you dry.

### A Social Grinchling

A common complaint from the people in our lives who don't suffer chronically is that we tend to isolate ourselves. Considering all the above... Does it really require an explanation as to why?

Much like the Grinch who isolated himself because he felt misunderstood his entire life, chronic pain sufferers are socially isolated from the people around them. Even when they are with everyone else, the fact that everything takes more effort means that you're going to burn out before they do. Nature tries to railroad you into being a buzzkill or a downer. Overcoming that takes significant efforts that nobody else seems to have to make just to be around each other.

I can't exist without friendships, the deep kind. That's a part of who I am. I prefer to be around others than with this person I so thoroughly dislike that I call myself. It's simply harder for me to see the bits I like, but friends reflect those back to me, through the general enjoyment we have around each other. I like myself more, cope with illness more, and hopefully enrich their lives as much as they enrich mine.

However, with chronic pain comes a few rules and regulations to existing in a social setting that are... Difficult.

I can't be touched.

I crave being touched. Hugs, handshakes, leaning on people. I'm the guy who puts an arm on your shoulder whilst we laugh together beside a fireplace. The person who lightly punches you when you tease me.

Or rather... I was. Half a lifetime ago.

Someone brushing my hand as they walk by me feels something akin to someone lightly pressing a hot coal into my hand for an hour or two. Shaking someone's hand causes a scorching agony that I will feel for half a day. A hug is something that will burn me for a day.

On a bad day, a hug from a friend will make me weep more than what I was suffering from before they tried to express their sympathy.

Obviously, all of this leads to a sort of detachment. A social isolation that is forcibly enforced with a rigour that no government could impose. From this forced exile, people make the assumption that I don't really like social situations. They think that I'm the quiet guy in the corner who would prefer not to be there. So, in their kindness, they withdraw from me.

With the fatigue, I no longer have the energy left to always being the one to make every overture and effort to remain a part of the group, and it becomes a self-reinforcing loop where only the very few are aware enough to make those efforts to keep me around.

I'm left thinking that I'm selfish and unkind, because I hope that people will make an effort to keep me involved. In truth, it is neither parties fault. I don't resent anyone for leaving me behind, and I shouldn't blame myself for when it inevitably happens either. Yet, it happens.

It takes a special kind of person to notice that someone with a chronic illness is falling away, and that they don't want to. It takes something miraculous for them to make sure it doesn't happen. For those of you that exist, who recognise yourself in my words, know that you have my adoration. Not mere gratefulness.
