Firstly: Widths on mobile are no longer as irritating as they were, and take up a decent amount of the screen. Before they tended to be overly "squeezed", especially quoteblocks. That should be a thing of the past.

Secondly: A very basic by pretty nice set of filters has been added for those of you who prefer "dark mode" schemes.

All in all, the CSS is still less than 40 readable lines, so it still isn't excessive, and you'll be pressed to notice the loading times, but it should look half-decent.
