Firstly, I've rewritten the way that TOC links appear, and secondly, the number that will appear. All the others have been pushed to the new [All Posts](%s) page (which includes a bunch of preview text, and so on). I'm considering if there's a way to make use of the `details` and `summary` HTML elements to default hide/show the rest of the links, but for now pushing them to another page is fine.

The footer TOC links also include hover-text as a sort of preview, which feels a little bit awesome. (Screenreaders - it's title text, so you'll probably hear it if you focus on a link).

All posts pages now include an estimated reading time, using the average 220WPM estimate.
