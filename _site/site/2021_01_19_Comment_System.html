Let me very clear - this system is not designed to be lowest bar to entry. You can absolutely post if you're not a sr.ht user, but it'll require you know how to send a plain text email. I have exactly zero problems with that.

The comments visible on the site will also not always be in sync with those marked in the issue threads. There will be a delay, as the comments are only fetched when the site goes through a rebuild. Again, I have no problems with that.

The comment system also requires I opt-in each page I want comments to appear on. I am lazy enough to consider automating that... But for now, it makes me query for a moment, and that is a good thing.

Intelligent discourse requires that we be able to communicate with each other in a patient and thought-out way. There is a propensity for all of us to [just want to tell our story](https://youtu.be/l2SL5ozX7wo), without listening first. If, at all. If a disagreement is to be had, then this insistence on just wanting to jam some truth down someone else's throat grows exponentially... Which is an unconvincing way to communicate.

Thus, having the bar raised from the floor is not a bad thing. (... And now you can go ahead and tell me that I'm wrong).
